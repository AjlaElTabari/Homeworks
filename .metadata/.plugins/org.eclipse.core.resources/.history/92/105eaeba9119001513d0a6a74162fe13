		 * living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her "directive", EVE takes the plant and automatically enters a 
		 * deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but, 
		 * true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive.
